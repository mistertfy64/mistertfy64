# Hello, my name is mistertfy64, and I am a stupid person who likes to make stuff harder for myself
Currently I am the Game Master and Sole Developer of [Mathematical Base Defenders](https://mathematicalbasedefenders.com), a ~~fun~~ stupid "number-cruncher" styled math game with <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?label=%e2%80%8b&query=usersRegistered&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmathematicalbasedefenders.com%2Fapi%2Fmetadata"> registered players so far.

I also have a personal website, which is at [https://mistertfy64.com](https://mistertfy64.com) where you can learn more about me.

Feel free to contact me through my contact methods listed through my website, and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Note that formal requests/inquiries should be sent through my e-mail address, but I read all my social media messages nonetheless.
