# Hello! 
My name is mistertfy64, and I am a stupid person who likes to make stuff harder for myself.

Currently I am the Administrator of [Mathematical Base Defenders](https://mathematicalbasedefenders.com), a ~~fun~~ stupid "number-cruncher" styled math game with <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?label=%e2%80%8b&query=usersRegistered&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmathematicalbasedefenders.com%2Fapi%2Fmetadata"> registered players so far. I'm the only person working on this now, so my role is basically Administrator/Game Master/Manager/Sole Developer.

I also have a personal website, which is at [https://mistertfy64.com](https://mistertfy64.com) where you can learn more about me.

I'm not that qualified to work in the software industry at the moment, but as a student, I did complete POSN Computer Camp 2 and won awards at various student-level competitions, which definitely makes me more credible. For a more formal way of assessing my achievements, you can view my [resume](https://storage.mistertfy64.com/resume.pdf) or [my certificate display](https://content.mistertfy64.com/portfolio/).

Feel free to contact me through my contact methods listed through my website, and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Note that formal requests/inquiries should be sent through my e-mail address, but I read all my social media messages nonetheless.
